## 🔥 Firebase Setup & Security

1. **Firestore Database ID**:
   - `ai-studio-mahdevpvtltd-b6505c20-1d3d-4de0-a4bb-a8fb7ae999dd`
2. **Security Rules**:
   - Rules are strictly governed in `firestore.rules`.
   - Client writes are restricted to authenticated users matching document ownership.
   - Administrative collections (`/admin_roles/`, `/audit_logs/`, `/system_settings/`) enforce role-based access.
3. **App Check**:
   - Automatically initializes in `src/App.tsx` with environment-sensitive debug attestation in development and reCAPTCHA v3 in production.

## 🌿 Branching & Git Workflow

We adhere to standard Git Flow:

- `main`: Production-ready, deployed release branch.
- `development`: Active integration and staging branch.
- `feature/*`: New functional units (e.g. `feature/sws-booking-calculator`).
- `fix/*`: Bug fixes (e.g. `fix/cart-currency-conversion`).
- `hotfix/*`: Urgent production patches.

### Conventional Commit Standards
All commits must use semantic commit prefixes:
```bash
feat: add SWS service package tier selection
fix: resolve customer booking phone number validation
perf: optimize Firestore product catalog query indexing
security: implement HMAC SHA-256 webhook signature verification
docs: update API documentation for invoice generation
chore: update npm dependencies
```

## 🚀 Deployment (Vercel & Cloud Run)

The repository is configured for automated CI/CD deployment via **Vercel** and container deployment via **Google Cloud Run**:

- **Vercel Deployment**: See [VERCEL_DEPLOYMENT.md](VERCEL_DEPLOYMENT.md) for full configuration, preview branch deployments, and domain setup.
- **Environment & Secrets Matrix**: See [ENV_VARIABLES.md](ENV_VARIABLES.md) for detailed variable documentation.

---

## 🛡️ Security Architecture & Anti-Abuse

- **Honeypot Traps**: Invisible input traps embedded in Registration, Booking Wizard, and Contact forms.
- **Velocity Validation**: Rejects sub-second programmatic bot submissions.
- **Disposable Email Defense**: Blocks temporary burner email domains on checkout and account creation.
- **Server Rate Limiting**: IP-based sliding window rate limiting on all API routes (`/api/orders/*`, `/api/invoices/*`, `/api/payment/*`).
- **Server-Authoritative Pricing**: Cart items and discounts are recalculated against the master server catalog to prevent client tampering.
